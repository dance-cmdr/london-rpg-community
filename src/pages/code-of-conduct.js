    <h1>Code of Conduct </h1>
    <p>
        <strong>The London RPG Community is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone wanting to participate in role-playing games and other activities.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>General Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This Code of Conduct applies to all events and online platforms hosted by LRC.</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Itâ€™s so important to have open and positive games, so we do not tolerate any kind of harassment in all interactions among community members. We will take action in response to harassment related to national origin, gender, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical characteristics, disability, religion, and age. 
    </p>

    <h2>What is harassment? What would we like to prevent here?</h2>
    <h4>
        Examples of unacceptable offline and online behaviours include:
    </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Verbal comments that are offensive and reinforce oppression related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion (or lack thereof); </li>
            <li>Imitating or making fun of accents or grammatical errors, or giving unsolicited grammar corrections (but clarifying questions are fine);</li>
            <li>General bullying;</li>
            <li>Verbal threats or demands;</li>

        </ol>
    <p>
        Participants who are asked to stop harassing behaviours are expected to cease immediately. Depending on severity of harassment or repeat offenses, GMs, event hosts, or Admins will respond appropriately, including - but not limited to - giving warnings or expulsion from the event or our online servers. With the consent of the person being harassed, local authorities will be called if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        We count on <strong>everyone</strong> to do their part to ensure positive experiences for all participants. 
         <strong>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please let us know.
        </strong>
