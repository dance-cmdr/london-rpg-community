    <h2>Welcome to the London RPG Community!</h2>
    <p>
      We are amazing adventurers, brave bards, dungeon delvers, rotten rebels,
      and smouldering scoundrels. We are a group of roleplayers who meet weekly
      to play tabletop RPGs. Whether itâ€™s high fantasy Dungeons & Dragons, or
      science fiction Star Wars, or Coriolis, or perhaps contemporary horror
      such as Call of Cthulhu, we like playing RPGs!

      We have an open D&D 5e campaign that anyone can join. Itâ€™s unique setting
      uses principles of a West Marches campaign, and story arcs similar to
      television seasons. Enjoy playing a long-form campaign without the regular
      schedule commitments! You can join a game directly through Meetup, though
      youâ€™ll have a better chance of reserving a space by signing up to the
      campaign forum.

      We also have seasonal RPG highlights, which are organised on our Discord,
      highlighting games through a series of one shot adventures such as Call of
      Cthulhu, or sci-fi games like Coriolis, Nibiru, Tales From The Loop, and
      Star Wars.

      Are you interested in setting up your own campaign? We have opportunities
      for you! Message any of the event organisers and weâ€™ll see what we can do
      to accommodate your campaign and find you players.
